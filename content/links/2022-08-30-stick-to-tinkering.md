### Comment

Really good perspective on tinkering.

> So, my advice to young developers, please stick to tinkering whenever possible. You won’t learn much reading the User Manual of your TV, only when you actually tinker with it you become a master. Tinkering will help you connect some dots in your brain that can’t be connected otherwise. It increases your “courage”, widens your perspective, and teach you how to fearlessly get out some tough situations.
