Interesting that maintenance issues in non tech domains are very similar to maintenance  and tech debt management in tech.

Coming from the human nature: short term gains are often more prioritized over greater long term gains.

From HN:

> When I studied Chinese in primary school, there was one ancient text that spoke about a discussion between a king and a famous doctor. The doctor explained that his brother was superior than him in the medical science but no one heard about him because he could always treat small illnesses before then evolved into terminal ones, so people said, "Oh he is a fine doctor, but he only treats minor illnesses".
