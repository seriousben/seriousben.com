### Comment

I really like the final four points:

1. Encapsulate complexity to your advantage. Make sure people can collaborate closely when the work requires it.

2. Establish clear transactional relationships and interfaces between groups that don't require intensive collaboration. Good walls make good neighbors.

3. Make sure that managers and leaders maintain relationships that mimic the relationships required by the people doing the work.

4. If possible, genuinely simplify our business processes—true simplification, not just in name.
