### My thoughts

I think the four factors described make a lot of sense:

1) what kind of life you want to create
2) your superpowers
3) what type of work energizes you
4) what type of people you love working with

I am a huge fan of intentionality. What is described is being able to recognize peer/cultural/social pressure in order to focus our what type of environment works for you. That aspect brings another layer to intentionality by also addressing our own bias and improving our decision making.

Really interesting framework when thinking about our career.
