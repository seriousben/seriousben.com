### My thoughts

Really down to earth list by Camille Fournier.

My highlights:
- How to find interesting work on your own, instead of waiting for someone to bring it to you
- How to get information about what’s really happening (how to gossip, how to network)
- How to repeat yourself enough that people start to listen
- How to teach another engineer to care about that thing you really care about (operations, correctness, testing, code quality, performance, simplicity, etc)
- How to listen to other engineers’ ideas without feeling threatened
- How to lead a project even though you don’t manage any of the people working on the project
