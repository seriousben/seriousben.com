### My thoughts

Lots of great scenarios/templates for their four parts of a retrospective:

- set the stage: Time to "arrive", get into the right mood and focus on the goal.


- Gather Data: Help everyone remember and create a shared pool of information.

- Generate Insights: Why did things happen this way? Any patterns? See the big picture.

- Close the retro: How could the retrospectives improve? Also clarify follow-up.

An amazing resource.
