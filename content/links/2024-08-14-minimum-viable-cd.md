### My thoughts

Great overview of the minimum CI and CD requirements to get the most out of them.

The most being: increased velocity, quality, engineering culture, developer experience, happiness.

Very similar to https://12factor.net/

Here are some highlights.

for CD:
- All feature work stops when the pipeline is red.
- Artifacts created by the pipeline always meet the organization’s definition of deployable. (Which makes me think of the definition of done of Scrum)
- Rollback on-demand

For CI:
- All feature work stops when the build is red
- Work integrates to the trunk at a minimum daily. (Which against makes me think of scrum with the idea of spitting work into small batches to help with highlighting the sprint's health)
