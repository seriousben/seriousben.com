### My thoughts

Insightful look at the why behind companies become taller instead of more flat as the company adds employees.

My summary is that these factor play a role:
- How much support do people need?
- Are stakeholders pushing for some roles to signal some company maturity?
- Was the company structure setup in a way where small teams were created in order to found and grow the teams?
- Was the role of team management given as a way to give growth opportunity?
-  Is there a belief of ratio between IC and manager that influences teams to be smaller?
- Is there a culture of individual projects or of team projects? Individual projects require someone to hand out there projects.
- Are members of team working on unrelated projects with unrelated stakeholders or collaborators?
- Is the manager workload shifted towards administrative tasks or team coordination tasks?
- Are the teams starting more projects than they finish? (WIP)
- How much interruptions are teams handling?
- How much priority change is there?
- How much turnover is there?
- How much clarity do people have on their responsibilities, goals, and priorities? If the clarity is low, it requires more frequent alignment.
