### My thoughts

A few that resonate the most with me:

- We are destroying software claiming that code comments are useless.
- We are destroying software mistaking it for a purely engineering discipline.
- We are destroying software by always thinking that the de-facto standard for XYZ is better than what we can do, tailored specifically for our use case.
