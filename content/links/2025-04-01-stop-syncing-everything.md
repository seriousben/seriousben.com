### My thoughts

Announcing an interesting replication project: https://github.com/orbitinghail/graft

> - Offline-first & mobile apps: Simplify development and improve reliability by offloading replication and storage to Graft.
> - Cross-platform sync: Share data smoothly across devices, browsers, and platforms without vendor lock-in.
> - Stateless multi-writer replicas: Deploy replicas anywhere, including serverless and embedded environments.
> - Any data type: Replicate databases, files, or custom formats—all with strong consistency.

And some links:
