### Comment

Interesting evaluation of the Spotify model.

Some of my key takeaways:

> the Spotify model is revealed as a collection of cross-functional teams with too much autonomy and a poor management structure. 

> Autonomy requires alignment. Company priorities must be defined by leadership. Autonomy does not mean teams get to do whatever they want.

> Processes for cross-team collaboration must be defined. Autonomy does not mean leaving teams to self-organize every problem.

> How success is measured must be defined by leadership so people can effectively negotiate cross-team dependency prioritization.
Autonomy requires accountability. 

> Product management is accountable for value. The team is accountable for delivering ‘done’ increments. Mature teams can justify their independence with their ability to articulate business value, risk, learning, and the next optimal move.
