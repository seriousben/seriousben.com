Good poem from a commenter in HN:
When I was three-and-twenty

I heard a wise man say,

"Put in your forty hours,

Don't give your soul away.

Hack the Python and the Ruby,

But keep your fancy free."

But I was twenty three

No use to talk to me.

.

When I was three-and-twenty

I heard him say again,

"The nodes out of the DOM

never do yield without pain.

'Tis paid with frameworks plenty,

Till your face turns blue."

And I am four-and-twenty,

And oh, 'tis true, 'tis true.
