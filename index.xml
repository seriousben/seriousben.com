Some of my key takeaways:
the Spotify model is revealed as a collection of cross-functional teams with too much autonomy and a poor management structure.
Autonomy requires alignment. Company priorities must be defined by leadership. Autonomy does not mean teams get to do whatever they want.
Processes for cross-team collaboration must be defined. Autonomy does not mean leaving teams to self-organize every problem.</description></item><item><title>Jepsen: MongoDB 4.2.6</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/jepsen-mongodb-4-2-6/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 22:52:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/jepsen-mongodb-4-2-6/</guid><description>Comment Oof
Jepsen evaluated MongoDB version 4.2.6, and found that even at the strongest levels of read and write concern, it failed to preserve snapshot isolation. Instead, Jepsen observed read skew, cyclic information flow, duplicate writes, and internal consistency violations. Weak defaults meant that transactions could lose writes and allow dirty reads, even downgrading requested safety levels at the database and collection level.

But ELBs did not (and still don&amp;rsquo;t) support proxying websocket traffic over their HTTP(S) listener. To support websocket traffic, a TCP listener is required. This means that the proxy server (ELB) looses knowledge of the HTTP protocol since it goes from being a layer 7 (application) proxy to being a layer 4 (transport) proxy.</description></item><item><title>Implementing Raft: Part 0 - Introduction</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/implementing-raft-part-0-introduction/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2020 13:25:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/implementing-raft-part-0-introduction/</guid><description>Comment First of a series of post.
