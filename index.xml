I was expecting a similar approach to https://github.com/xacrimon/dashmap / https://docs.rs/dashmap/latest/dashmap/ which does sharding to reduce lock contention.
sync.Map is pretty interesting, it offers CAS-like functions and has a whole state machine for entries in order to reduce lock contention.

It can be summarized as:
If a decision will be cheap to reverse and have a low impact on its intended audience, just get some advice from a peer, as shown in the bottom left quadrant. If it will be expensive to reverse, or have a high audience impact, ask two or three stakeholders for advice, as shown in the top left and bottom right quadrants.</description></item><item><title>We are destroying software</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/2025-02-11-we-are-destroying-software/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:19:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/2025-02-11-we-are-destroying-software/</guid><description>My thoughts Antirez listing all the ways we are destroying software.
A few that resonate the most with me:
We are destroying software pushing for rewrites of things that work. We are destroying software claiming that code comments are useless. We are destroying software mistaking it for a purely engineering discipline. We are destroying software by always thinking that the de-facto standard for XYZ is better than what we can do, tailored specifically for our use case.</description></item><item><title>Satisficing</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/2025-02-11-satisficing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:16:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/2025-02-11-satisficing/</guid><description>My thoughts Satisficing is a decision-making strategy or cognitive heuristic that entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met, without necessarily maximizing any specific objective.

BM25 is similar to TF/IDF. In both cases, the key idea is to consider statistics of the overall corpus as part of relevance calculations. If the user searches for &amp;ldquo;charities in new orleans&amp;rdquo; in a corpus where &amp;ldquo;new orleans&amp;rdquo; is only represented in a few documents, those should clearly rank highly. If the corpus has &amp;ldquo;new orleans&amp;rdquo; in almost every document then the term &amp;ldquo;charity&amp;rdquo; is more important.</description></item><item><title>Implementing faceted search with Django and PostgreSQL</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/2024-08-07-implementing-faceted-search-with-django-and-postgresql/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 11:20:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/2024-08-07-implementing-faceted-search-with-django-and-postgresql/</guid><description>My thoughts Great detailed look at implementing faceted search using postgres.

From the &amp;ldquo;The Mythical Man-Month&amp;rdquo;. Useful syndrome to keep in mind when &amp;ldquo;re-writing&amp;rdquo; a working system. The complexity of having parity and adding new capabilities is often underestimated.

Encapsulate complexity to your advantage. Make sure people can collaborate closely when the work requires it.
Establish clear transactional relationships and interfaces between groups that don&amp;rsquo;t require intensive collaboration. Good walls make good neighbors.
Make sure that managers and leaders maintain relationships that mimic the relationships required by the people doing the work.

Coming from the human nature: short term gains are often more prioritized over greater long term gains.
From HN:
When I studied Chinese in primary school, there was one ancient text that spoke about a discussion between a king and a famous doctor. The doctor explained that his brother was superior than him in the medical science but no one heard about him because he could always treat small illnesses before then evolved into terminal ones, so people said, &amp;ldquo;Oh he is a fine doctor, but he only treats minor illnesses&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Ask HN: Name 3-5 books that had the most impact on your career and knowledge?</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-09-19-ask-hn-name-3-5-books-that-had-the-most-impact-on-your-career-and-knowledge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 23:14:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-09-19-ask-hn-name-3-5-books-that-had-the-most-impact-on-your-career-and-knowledge/</guid><description>Comment Great list of books

In HN a comment is very interesting:
This will sound pretty harsh, but if your company chooses to use open source code that does not have capable, paid, full time professionals reviewing it for security and quality, then your company is signing up for that responsibility. If you make no reasonable attempt at vetting your supply chain and harm comes to users as a result, then IMO you should be liable for negligence just like a restaurant serving food with poisonous ingredients.</description></item><item><title>Using WebTransport</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-09-17-using-webtransport/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2022 13:22:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-09-17-using-webtransport/</guid><description>Comment My understanding: UDP websockets.

Focusing on key areas that have the biggest impact helps keeping things moving. It feels simpler, but it does not make the problem simpler.
A complex problem cannot be simplified.
If you can simplify it, then it isn’t a complex problem.
You may choose to focus energy on a key leverage point, or establish one or more enabling constraints. To make progress, you may choose to selectively ignore things, blur your vision, or think in broad strokes.</description></item><item><title>Falsehoods programmers believe about email</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-09-01-falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-email/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 11:06:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-09-01-falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-email/</guid><description>Comment Great list.

So, my advice to young developers, please stick to tinkering whenever possible. You won’t learn much reading the User Manual of your TV, only when you actually tinker with it you become a master. Tinkering will help you connect some dots in your brain that can’t be connected otherwise. It increases your “courage”, widens your perspective, and teach you how to fearlessly get out some tough situations.</description></item><item><title>Research Paper Simple Template</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-08-24-research-paper-simple-template/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 23:35:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-08-24-research-paper-simple-template/</guid><description>Comment Using this to format blog posts also seems like a good idea.
