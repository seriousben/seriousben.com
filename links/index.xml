The section &amp;ldquo;Working with TPMs as engineers and EMs&amp;rdquo; is particularly interesting.
Don’t forget what’s in it for you as an engineering manager or engineer, in working with a TPM. By being able to work with a TPM, you have someone who worries – and takes care of – the project being shipped across multiple teams. This means you can spend more time on your own work and less time worrying about other teams.</description></item><item><title>Balancing Safety and Velocity in CI/CD at Slack</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-02-18-balancing-safety-and-velocity-in-ci-cd-at-slack/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 11:06:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-02-18-balancing-safety-and-velocity-in-ci-cd-at-slack/</guid><description>Comment Very interesting take on end-to-end tests

The problem is that runbooks are documented failure: failure to fix things properly, failure to automate solutions, failure to prioritize. Furthermore, runbooks are often praised for being clear and easy to use. In reality, the clearer and easier a runbook is to execute, the more unforgivable it is that you haven’t automated the solution.
The Catch-22 Of Runbooks is Any runbook that is easy to execute should not exist.</description></item><item><title>Modern public TLS is a quite different thing than it used to be</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-02-10-modern-public-tls-is-a-quite-different-thing-than-it-used-to-be/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2022 13:37:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-02-10-modern-public-tls-is-a-quite-different-thing-than-it-used-to-be/</guid><description>Comment Tons of insights into TLS

Some of my key takeaways:
the Spotify model is revealed as a collection of cross-functional teams with too much autonomy and a poor management structure.
Autonomy requires alignment. Company priorities must be defined by leadership. Autonomy does not mean teams get to do whatever they want.
Processes for cross-team collaboration must be defined. Autonomy does not mean leaving teams to self-organize every problem.</description></item><item><title>Jepsen: MongoDB 4.2.6</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/jepsen-mongodb-4-2-6/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 22:52:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/jepsen-mongodb-4-2-6/</guid><description>Comment Oof
Jepsen evaluated MongoDB version 4.2.6, and found that even at the strongest levels of read and write concern, it failed to preserve snapshot isolation. Instead, Jepsen observed read skew, cyclic information flow, duplicate writes, and internal consistency violations. Weak defaults meant that transactions could lose writes and allow dirty reads, even downgrading requested safety levels at the database and collection level.
