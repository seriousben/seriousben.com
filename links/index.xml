Coming from the human nature: short term gains are often more prioritized over greater long term gains.
From HN:
When I studied Chinese in primary school, there was one ancient text that spoke about a discussion between a king and a famous doctor. The doctor explained that his brother was superior than him in the medical science but no one heard about him because he could always treat small illnesses before then evolved into terminal ones, so people said, &amp;ldquo;Oh he is a fine doctor, but he only treats minor illnesses&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Ask HN: Name 3-5 books that had the most impact on your career and knowledge?</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-09-19-ask-hn-name-3-5-books-that-had-the-most-impact-on-your-career-and-knowledge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 23:14:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-09-19-ask-hn-name-3-5-books-that-had-the-most-impact-on-your-career-and-knowledge/</guid><description>Comment Great list of books

In HN a comment is very interesting:
This will sound pretty harsh, but if your company chooses to use open source code that does not have capable, paid, full time professionals reviewing it for security and quality, then your company is signing up for that responsibility. If you make no reasonable attempt at vetting your supply chain and harm comes to users as a result, then IMO you should be liable for negligence just like a restaurant serving food with poisonous ingredients.</description></item><item><title>Using WebTransport</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-09-17-using-webtransport/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2022 13:22:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-09-17-using-webtransport/</guid><description>Comment My understanding: UDP websockets.

Focusing on key areas that have the biggest impact helps keeping things moving. It feels simpler, but it does not make the problem simpler.
A complex problem cannot be simplified.
If you can simplify it, then it isn’t a complex problem.
You may choose to focus energy on a key leverage point, or establish one or more enabling constraints. To make progress, you may choose to selectively ignore things, blur your vision, or think in broad strokes.</description></item><item><title>Falsehoods programmers believe about email</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-09-01-falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-email/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 11:06:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-09-01-falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-email/</guid><description>Comment Great list.

So, my advice to young developers, please stick to tinkering whenever possible. You won’t learn much reading the User Manual of your TV, only when you actually tinker with it you become a master. Tinkering will help you connect some dots in your brain that can’t be connected otherwise. It increases your “courage”, widens your perspective, and teach you how to fearlessly get out some tough situations.</description></item><item><title>Research Paper Simple Template</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-08-24-research-paper-simple-template/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 23:35:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-08-24-research-paper-simple-template/</guid><description>Comment Using this to format blog posts also seems like a good idea.

The section &amp;ldquo;Working with TPMs as engineers and EMs&amp;rdquo; is particularly interesting.
Don’t forget what’s in it for you as an engineering manager or engineer, in working with a TPM. By being able to work with a TPM, you have someone who worries – and takes care of – the project being shipped across multiple teams. This means you can spend more time on your own work and less time worrying about other teams.</description></item><item><title>Balancing Safety and Velocity in CI/CD at Slack</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-02-18-balancing-safety-and-velocity-in-ci-cd-at-slack/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 11:06:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-02-18-balancing-safety-and-velocity-in-ci-cd-at-slack/</guid><description>Comment Very interesting take on end-to-end tests

The problem is that runbooks are documented failure: failure to fix things properly, failure to automate solutions, failure to prioritize. Furthermore, runbooks are often praised for being clear and easy to use. In reality, the clearer and easier a runbook is to execute, the more unforgivable it is that you haven’t automated the solution.
The Catch-22 Of Runbooks is Any runbook that is easy to execute should not exist.</description></item><item><title>Modern public TLS is a quite different thing than it used to be</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-02-10-modern-public-tls-is-a-quite-different-thing-than-it-used-to-be/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2022 13:37:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/2022-02-10-modern-public-tls-is-a-quite-different-thing-than-it-used-to-be/</guid><description>Comment Tons of insights into TLS

Some of my key takeaways:
the Spotify model is revealed as a collection of cross-functional teams with too much autonomy and a poor management structure.
Autonomy requires alignment. Company priorities must be defined by leadership. Autonomy does not mean teams get to do whatever they want.
Processes for cross-team collaboration must be defined. Autonomy does not mean leaving teams to self-organize every problem.</description></item><item><title>Jepsen: MongoDB 4.2.6</title><link>https://seriousben.com/links/jepsen-mongodb-4-2-6/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 22:52:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seriousben.com/links/jepsen-mongodb-4-2-6/</guid><description>Comment Oof
Jepsen evaluated MongoDB version 4.2.6, and found that even at the strongest levels of read and write concern, it failed to preserve snapshot isolation. Instead, Jepsen observed read skew, cyclic information flow, duplicate writes, and internal consistency violations. Weak defaults meant that transactions could lose writes and allow dirty reads, even downgrading requested safety levels at the database and collection level.
